            <h2>3D Printed Product Quality Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>Please be aware that our products are created using 3D printing technology. This manufacturing process has unique characteristics that you should understand before purchasing.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Layer Lines:</strong> 3D printing involves building an object layer by layer. As a result, subtle, fine lines will be visible on the surface of the products. These are a natural and unavoidable part of the 3D printing process and are not considered a defect.</li>
                <li><strong>Minor Imperfections:</strong> While we strive for the highest quality possible, small imperfections such as bumps or fine stringing may occur. We have a strict quality control process to ensure that only the best products are sent to our customers, but the unique nature of 3D printing means that no two items are exactly identical.</li>
                <li><strong>Material Properties:</strong> Our products are typically printed with PLA, a biodegradable and environmentally friendly plastic. Please be aware that PLA can warp or deform if exposed to high temperatures (e.g., left in a hot car, placed in a dishwasher). Please handle with care.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By purchasing our 3D printed products, you acknowledge and accept that these characteristics are inherent to the manufacturing process and contribute to the unique charm of each item.</p>
